# Encryption-and-Decryption-project
The project consists of the implementation of 3 algorithms for encrypting and decrypting a message, 2 of them being modern symmetric algorithms, those being the Blowfish algorithm and the AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, and 1 public key algorithm, the one implemented for this project being the RSA algorithm. The keys used in the application will be generated and stored on the disk. The algorithms listed above are written using Python.
